### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Benjamin, a IT and Tech :computer: enthusiast, graduated from the University Of Applied Sciences in Amsterdam starting a new study at Codam - Amsterdam. Besides working on IT projects, I like to:
1. Work out :muscle:
2. Read :books:
3. Work on hobby projects to learn more about the tools and design structures that in my opinion, a good game developer should know about.

I am a skilled independent worker with an experienced team mindset from multiple company experiences :office:. I am familiar with version control systems like git and collaborative methodologies like Scrum and Kanban.

Having worked at ING on Virtual Reality, Networking and Communication of Quantum Technology through gamification, I am able to communicate my work optimally with colleagues and/or stakeholders. Specializing in game development :video_game: and usage of game engines like the Unity Game Engine, I am able to write fast, readable and maintainable code in a short amount of time and apply code and/or engine specific best practices. Having worked as Technical Architect and Sublead Unity Developer at DTT, I am able to design, set up and manage game development projects and communicate progress effectively.
